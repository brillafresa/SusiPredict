# Cursor Rules for SusiPredict Project

## Development Guidelines

### Streamlit Application Management

- **Single Port Usage**: Always use the default Streamlit port (8501) for development
- **Process Cleanup**: Before starting Streamlit, ensure no other instances are running
- **Restart Pattern**: Use `taskkill /f /im streamlit.exe` to stop existing processes, then `streamlit run app.py` to restart
- **No Multiple Ports**: Avoid running multiple Streamlit instances on different ports (8502, 8503, etc.)

### Code Quality

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write comprehensive docstrings for functions and classes
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### Testing

- Run tests before making significant changes: `pytest`
- Ensure all tests pass before committing changes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

### Git Workflow

- Make atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Use conventional commit format when possible
- Test changes locally before pushing
- Keep commits focused on single features or fixes

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all version changes
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md for development process changes
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling for user inputs
- Provide clear error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### Performance

- Optimize code for readability first, then performance
- Profile code when performance issues arise
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Avoid unnecessary computations in loops

### Security

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- Validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices for web applications
